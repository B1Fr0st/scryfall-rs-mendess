A wrapper around the scryfall magic the gathering api

This is a work in progress, but the basic api is wrapped and can be used,
but until v1.0 breaking changes should be expected.

## TODO

[ ] Search Wrapper
[ ] Use `reqwest::Client` for faster requests
[ ] Cache results as requested by the `scryfall` API
