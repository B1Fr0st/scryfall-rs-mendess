A wrapper around the scryfall magic the gathering API

This is a work in progress, but the basic api is wrapped and can be used,
however until v1.0 releases breaking changes should be expected.

## TODO

- [ ] Search Wrapper
  - Shortcuts and nicknames
  - Exact Names
  - Using "OR"
  - Display Keywords

- [x] Use `reqwest::Client` for faster requests

- [ ] Cache results as requested by the `scryfall` API
